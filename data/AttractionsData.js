    Description: [
      `Islam arrived early in Ethiopia. In 615, The Prophet's wife and cousin, as well as Prophet Mohammed’s earliest followers (the “Assabs”) sought 
      refuge at Axum (Aksum). This group was fleeing from Mecca's leading tribe, the reactionary Kuraysh, who sent emissaries to bring them back to 
      Arabia, but the Negus Armah protected them. They were accepted and allowed to flourish under the protection of the king of Axum. In appreciation 
      of this, the Prophet himself instructed his followers to respect and protect Ethiopians. There is an injunction in the Koran against violence 
      by Muslims directed at Ethiopia.`,
      `Hence, there were Ethiopian Muslims even during the lifetime of Prophet Mohammed. Most of Ethiopia's Muslims are Sunnis, members of the largest 
      sect of Islam. An influx of immigrants and traders from Oman and Yemen during the following centuries increased the number of Muslims in Somalia, 
      Eritrea and what is now Ethiopia.`,
      `In the coastal areas, Islamic law gradually took root, and by the fourteenth century it was the basis for the official juridical code of some 
      regions. This reflected political realities; most of the inhabitants of these eastern regions were now Muslims.`,
      `Their coexistence with Christianity was not always an easy one, and the sultans who ruled over parts of Ethiopian territory sometimes came into 
      open conflict with the Christian kings.Yet, historians generally agree that the Muslim sultans in Ethiopia were tolerant of their Christian 
      subjects; forced conversions were rare.`,
      `In 1668, an imperial decree was issued declaring that the Muslims (Jabarti) and Jews (Felasha) of Gonder would henceforth have to live apart 
      from Christians, but they were allowed to practice their religion freely in their own quarter. Religious squabbles did not end there, but by 
      the nineteenth century peaceful conditions were established which finally placed religious differences on a level secondary to peace and 
      the popular interest.`,
      `Political conflicts between Ethiopia and Somalia, and, more recently, between Ethiopia and Eritrea, are not based on religious differences per se.
      Its Muslim Arab population has never been large, but Ethiopia has had historically close contact with Yemen and the Asir region of Saudi Arabia. Most 
      of the Ethiopians in these countries are Muslims. Estimates vary, but from 40 to 50 percent of Ethiopia's population is Muslim.`,

      - the massif is cut by streams and gorges. The national park has three general botanical regions. The lower slopes have been cultivated 
      and grazed, while the alpine regions (up to 3600m) are forested. The higher lands are mountain grasslands with fescue grasses as well 
      as heathers, splendid Red Hot Pokers and Giant Lobelia. The park was created primarily to protect the Walia Ibex, a type of wild goat, 
      and over 1000 are said to live in the park. Also in the park are families of the Gelada Baboon and the rare Simien fox. The Simien fox, 
      although named after the mountains, is rarely seen by the visitor. Over 50 species of birds have been reported in the Simien Mountains.`,

          altitude plateau area at 4,000 m altitude. The plateau is formed of ancient volcanic rocks (trachytes, basalts, agglomerates and tuffs) 
          dissected by many Rivers and streams that have cut deep gorges into the edges over the centuries. In some places this has resulted in 
          scenic waterfalls. From the plateau rise several mountain massifs of rounded and craggy peaks, including Tullu Deemtu the second-highest 
          mountain in Ethiopia at 4,377 m above sea level. (Ras Dashen, near the Simien Mountains National Park in the north is the

          `The high rainfall in the Bale Mountains, together with the great variation in altitude and topography, result in rich diversity in the vegetation. 
          Changes in the vegetation with altitude are clearly seen, this zonation being a result of increasing then decreasing rainfall as you ascend, 
          generally decreasing temperatures, and increased exposure of rock and resulting poorer soils.The mountains are surrounded to the northwest and 
          northeast by fertile plains at 2,500 m that are heavily utilized for agriculture mainly wheat growing. This is succeeded by remnants of 
          beautiful juniper and Kosso (Hagenia abyssinica) forest -a belt that reaches up to about 3,300 m altitude, which is the upper limit of the 
          tree zone, apart from a few isolated trees in protected valleys. Above the tree line the heather moorlands begin, reaching to about 3,600 m 
          altitudes on gently sloping ground, and as high as 3,800 m on steep rocky slopes. Above this are various forms of Afro-Alpine moorland, 
          dominated by different plants depending on slope, drainage and rodent activity. The tops of most of the high peaks are either bare rocks, 
          or exposed soil with very small hardy tussock herbs or grasses. To the south, the land falls away far more, through rich and varied forest 
          below the heather, containing bamboo and giant Podocarpus trees, and finally giving way to dry short-tree wooded grasslands at 1,600 m on 
          the southern boundary of the Park.`,

          in many cases rise to over thirty metres in height. Higher reaches of the forests, near Katcha at 2,600 m, are interspersed with bamboo 
          groves, and many wildflowers beside the small rushing torrents. Early in the wet season, dense thickets of edible Rubus steudneri in

          and visits to the Gaysay area, and the Sanetti plateau will ensure you see both. The Mountain Nyala is a large antelope in the spiral-horned 
          antelope family. Males are a dark brown colour with a pair of gently spiraled horns with white tips. They bear handsome white markings on the 
          face, neck and legs, together with usually at least one stripe and some white spots on each side. The hornless females are a lighter brown 
          colour, and typically have the same white markings as the males, though less often have stripes, but normally have spots on the sides. 
          Males can weigh as much as 280 kilos, stand one and a half metres at the shoulder, and have a mane of long erectile hairs along the spine. 
          Females weigh less and have no mane.Younger animals are lighter in colour, and young males bear tiny spike horns from about five months of 
          age, that go through various shapes as they develop. Both sexes have enormous ears. Mountain Nyala are especially numerous in the Gaysay 
          area, and occur in small scattered groups else where in the Park at all altitudes. They are mainly browsers - feeding on bushes and herbs, 
          but also eat grass. Groups vary in size -from lone adult males, or a female with her offspring from the last two years, to aggregations of 
          over seventy animals. Males may be seen to make strange slow, strutting displays at each other, or to dig the earth with their horns and

          and nowhere else in the world. The animal is the size and color of a European Red Fox, but with long legs, longer muzzle, and a striking black 
          and white tail. The male and female are similar in appearance. Semien Fox feed on rodents, and as a result are mainly found at the higher 
          altitudes where rodents abound. The Sanetti Plateau is an especially good area to see them, but they do occur in higher parts of the mountains, 
          as well as down at Gaysay on rare occasions. They are usually seen hunting alone, but can be seen in pairs, and after the breeding season as 
          many as eight adults and cubs have been seen together. The Semien Fox hunts their prey by standing still over the rodent holes, patiently 
          listening, turning their head and ears from side to side, and suddenly pouncing when a rat emerges. They will also dig to reach rats on 
          occasions. They give a high yelping bark. To keep contact with other foxes, and when apprehensive about anything such as your close proximity. 
          They are well camouflaged amongst the lichen - covered rocks of the plateau and can be very hard to see, despite their striking orange-red 
          colour.There are more than twenty other small to large-sized mammals to be seen in the Park. Some are sighted only rarely or are known by 
          the evidence they leave -such as droppings and footprints. Menelik's Bushbuck is a form, or subspecies, of the one commonly found over 
          most of Africa. It is very different however, in that the adult male is a jet-black color, and both sexes are long-haired. Bushbuck 
          are the smallest of the Mountain Nyala family that also includes the Greater and Lesser Kudu, Eland, Bongo and Sitatunga. Like these 
          other animals, the bushbuck has spirally twisted horns and spots and stripes on the coat. However, the horns -found in the male only - 
          are relatively short. They are relatively easy to see at Dinsho and Gaysay, and are especially plentiful in the forest and heather of 
          the Adelay ridge. They are not found on the high plateau however which is largely devoid of vegetation cover, and have rarely been 
          sighted at altitudes over 3,400 m.After the Mountain Nyala, the next most common antelope is the Bohor Reedbuck. These 
          medium-sized straw-coloured antelope are found in large numbers in the flat grasslands and swamps round Gaysay mountain. 
          Males are easily recognized from their forward-pointing hooked horns. Reedbuck are almost only found in the Gaysay and Adelay 
          grasslands, there being no suitable long-grass areas higher in the mountains. Grey Duiker are the smallest antelope in the Park. 
          They occur at Gaysay and in the valleys with sufficient vegetation cover up to about 3,700 m altitude. They are usually seen alone, diving 
          into cover. Only the males have the short straight horns.`,

          agile existence amongst the rocks and cliffs. They probably derive their Amharic name of "Saas" from their strange sneezing alarm call. 
          Warthog are reasonably common in the Gaysay grasslands and forest patches and on Adelay ridge. Groups with large numbers of piglets are 
          frequently seen in the dry and early wet seasons. Warthog are not found at higher altitudes in the mountains. Bushpig and Giant Forest

           Sanetti Plateau, and large flocks of the White-collared Pigeon feed on the ground here at the same period. The weird-Iooking Thick-billed 
           Raven is a denizen of most villages, and usually finds your camp at any altitude. The colourful little green and red Black-winged 
           Love-birds are seen in large numbers in the forest areas, while the larger Yellow-fronted Parrot is less often seen in the same habitat. 
           The strident ringing calls of the shy Abyssinian Catbird betray its presence in forest. Close observation in the Gaysay grasslands 
           and beside the main road will reveal the Abyssinian Long claw -a drab little bird, but with a smart yellow bib. The high plateau is 
           characterized by large flocks of the little black and yellow Black-headed Siskin.The Bale Mountains, rich in streams and little 
           Alpine lakes, provide food and security for unusual water birds such as the Ruddy Shelduck and the tall elegant 
          Wattled Crane. Many European ducks and waders pass the dry season in the mountains, before returning to Europe, as do several birds of

          cheery Mountain Chat - puffed up like a round feathered ball in the icy dawn, hopping from tussock to tussock as he investigates you. 
          One of the largest and most spectacular birds is the Lammergeier also called the Bearded Vulture or Bone-breaker. This enormous bird 
          with its over-two-metre wingspan is often seen soaring alone over suitably high cliffs and rock outcrops, while splintered bone

          `Bale Mountains National Park is essentially a walking area. Mountain bike or Horse treks of several days duration into the main peak 
          area with pack and riding horses or bikes and accompanied by a guide, can be arranged through Dinknesh or the Park authorities 
          in Dinsho. In addition, shorter walks or treks can be accomplished in the Dinsho area, or from anywhere along the roads and tracks 
          mentioned above.At Dinsho Headquarters a one kilometre Nature Trail has been designed up Dinsho Hill. This gives a brief introduction 
          to the plants and animals of the area, and the location of the main Park. There is the added opportunity of seeing Mountain Nyala at 
          close quarters on foot, in the Sanctuary afforded by the fence around the compound. From the top of the hill (3,240 m) good views on 
          a clear day in all directions help in understanding the layout of the Park.Walking on Gaysay hill is rewarding in terms of the views 
          and the chances of seeing wildlife at close quarters. The physically fit will find the steep climb to the Boditi summit (3,520 m) 
          worthwhile for a spectacular view of the Gaysay River flats and south into the main Park area.A very enjoyable day-Iong walk can be 
          had from Dinsho, up the Web valley to Gasuray peak (3,325 m). The steep Climb to the summit is through beautiful mature Hagenia and 
          juniper forest, and into heather at the top. A traverse of the uplands to the north along the connecting spur to the Adelay ridge leads 
          you through beautiful heather and grass glades with the strange grey tussocks of Helichrysum citrispinum -one of the "everlasting flowers". 
          Mountain nyala, Klipspringer. Menelik's Bushbuck and Warthog are commonly encountered here. A steep descent off the northeast corner of 
          Adelay brings you back down to the main road and Dinsho village.The Sanetti Plateau is crowned by several peaks that add a good walk to the 
          drive over it. Konteh Tullu - the striking volcanic plug east of the road on the plateau, may look formidable, but twenty minutes of 
          steep scrambling from its base gives you magnificent views from the top (4, 132 m) in all directions. Tullu Deemtu is the second 
          highest mountain in Ethiopia at 4,377 m, and the highest point in the Bale Mountains. Starting from the main road at its base it 
          takes one and a half to two hours to climb the slopes and reach the summit - a rounded ridge hidden from the aspect of your starting 
          point. Hares and rodents abound up here, despite the sparse vegetation cover. Mountain Nyala are often seen below the summit to the 
          south where there is a small water seepage point and grove of Giant Lobelia plants. Wide views can be had all around, but especially 
          to the main plateau with its lakes and lava flows to the west, and to Mt. Batu a short distance north`

          `Short riding trips can be arranged in the Dinsho area, but it is far more worthwhile to set aside at least four full days to enjoy 
          a horse trip to the full. Arrangements are best made beforehand by letter or phone, but horses can be organized for a morning 
          departure if requested the afternoon before. Various routes can be followed, and it is best to take the advice of your local guide from Dinsho.`

          `Nine Rivers and streams between Adaba and Goba were stocked with trout in the early 1970' s. These have thrived and are now 
          available for sport fishing. Information, guides and permits can be obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture offices in Adaba, 
          Dinsho and Goba.Brown Trout can be fished on a short stretch of the Web River near Dinsho, while all the other Rivers are stocked 
          with Rainbow. Anglers have to provide all their own equipment. Fishing conditions are varied - cascading waterfalls, deep still pools, 
          or the tiny narrow and clear Danka stream. Good exercise, beautiful scenery, peaceful surroundings, are all combined in the one activity.`

      `Ethiopia is home to several unique and endemic mammals found nowhere else in the world. Key species include the Ethiopian wolf, the rarest 
      canid globally, which roams the highlands, and the Gelada baboon, known for its striking red chest patch and grass-eating habits. The Mountain 
      Nyala, a large antelope, inhabits the Bale Mountains, while the Menelik’s bushbuck is another highland species. These animals, adapted to 
      Ethiopia’s diverse ecosystems, are integral to the country’s rich biodiversity and conservation efforts.`,
